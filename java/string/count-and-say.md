## Count and Say


### 描述

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:

```
1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.

`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.

`21` is read off as `"one 2"`, then `"one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer `n`, generate the nth sequence.

Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
